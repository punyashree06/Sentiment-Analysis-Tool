# Sentiment-Analysis-Tool
Build a sentiment analysis tool that can determine the sentiment of a given text (positive, negative, neutral). Here we are using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models.

Key Features:

Data collection from sources like Twitter or movie reviews.
Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization).
Feature extraction using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings.
Model training using classifiers such as Logistic Regression, SVM, or LSTM.
Interactive web interface to input text and display results using Flask or Django.

Tech Stack:

Python (NLTK, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras)
Flask/Django for web interface
HTML/CSS/JavaScript for front-end
